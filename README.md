    2. Once you have installed IDEA install Cucumber for scala
    3. Clone this repo.
    4. Import the project in InteliJ
    
###  Execute sample test scenarios

This project is a template to get started with cucumber, do not focus on the example scenarios. Create Scenarios that will run on your own teams working environment.
However if you just want to see the tests running, you can execute these via command line via the ./run_integration_dev.sh script
Or you can execute via JUNIT within InteliJ:

    1. Make sure you are on VPN
    2. Start TAXS microservice
    3. Go to Step definitions folder
    4. Right click on RunTestSuite, select RunTestSuite
